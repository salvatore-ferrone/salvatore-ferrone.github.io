I am a PhD student working in Galactic Astronomy. I make simulations of the orbits of stars within the Milky Way, particularly those coming from [globular clusters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globular_cluster). This is my barebones personal portfolio. Here is a link to my ADS publications: [Ads](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/fq=%7B!type%3Daqp%20v%3D%24fq_database%7D&fq_database=(database%3Aastronomy%20OR%20database%3Aphysics)&p_=0&q=%20author%3A%22Ferrone%2C%20Salvatore%22&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc).
