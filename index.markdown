Welcome to my portfolio! I’m Salvatore Ferrone, a PhD student specializing in Galactic Astronomy. My research focuses on simulating the orbits of stars within the Milky Way, particularly those originating from globular clusters.

This site serves as a simple showcase of my work. For a detailed list of my contributions, you can check out my [publications on ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/fq=%7B!type%3Daqp%20v%3D%24fq_database%7D&fq_database=(database%3Aastronomy%20OR%20database%3Aphysics)&p_=0&q=%20author%3A%22Ferrone%2C%20Salvatore%22&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc).

As part of my thesis, I’ve developed an open-source Python package called `tstrippy` (**T**idal-**Strip***ping-**Py**thon). While it’s not designed to compete with established tools like Agama, Gala, or Galpy, tstrippy enables the reproducibility and public verification of my research. You can explore the code's functionality and find installation instructions at [tstrippy.readthedocs.io/](https://tstrippy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

I’m also documenting my PhD thesis as a public manuscript. It will evolve over time, starting from a mid-thesis report written in winter 2023/2024 to the final version, expected by August 2025. You can follow the process and access the current draft here: [salvatore-ferrone.github.io/phd-thesis-ferrone/](https://salvatore-ferrone.github.io/phd-thesis-ferrone/).
