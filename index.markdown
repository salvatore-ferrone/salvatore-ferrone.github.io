I am a PhD student working in Galactic Astronomy. I make simulations of the orbits of stars within the Milky Way, particularly those coming from [globular clusters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globular_cluster). This is my barebones personal portfolio. To quickly display some of my work, here is a link to my [publications on ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/fq=%7B!type%3Daqp%20v%3D%24fq_database%7D&fq_database=(database%3Aastronomy%20OR%20database%3Aphysics)&p_=0&q=%20author%3A%22Ferrone%2C%20Salvatore%22&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc). I am making the code I developed for my thesis open source. I call the package `tstrippy` for **T**idal-**Strip**ping-**Py**thon. I don't plan for this to compete with the already grand galactic astronomy packages such as Agama, Gala, and Galpy. But, I wanted to show that my work can be reproduced and checked publicly. Some examples of the code's functionality and download instructions can be found @ [tstrippy.readthedocs.io/](https://tstrippy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Lastly, I will be writing my seinor thesis over January-August 2025, starting from a mid-thesis report that was written in the winter of 2023/2024. The manuscript will remain public throughout the entire writing process. The current version is available here [https://salvatore-ferrone.github.io/phd-thesis-ferrone/](https://salvatore-ferrone.github.io/phd-thesis-ferrone/).
